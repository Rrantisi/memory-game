About the game: 

To start, simply click the start game button. All the cards will be visible and you will have 3 seconds to memorize the cards. After that, they will be face down and you will have to find all matching pairs to win the game. 
You will have 45 seconds and 12 lives for each turn you play. If either one reaches zero you will lose the game.
Player score will be the same as the moves count. The lower the number, the higher the score.

Good Luck!
