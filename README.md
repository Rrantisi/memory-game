## About:
Test your concentration with this twenty-card memory game. You will have 3 seconds to memorize all the cards before starting the game. Each time you play, you will have 45 seconds and 12 lives to find all the matching pairs. 
Your score will be based on your moves count. The lower the number, the higher you score.
